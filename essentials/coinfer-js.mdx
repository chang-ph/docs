- `ðŸ“‚assets`: Some resource files required by the project, such as pictures referenced in the document, etc.
- `ðŸ“‚build-scripts`: Some script codes required for building, such as clearing folders, copying static files, etc.
- `ðŸ“‚build-template`: Some static files required for building, such as package dependencies (`package.json`), README.md used to describe the built package, etc.
- `ðŸ“‚document-generator`: This folder is used to store the code for generating the project API documentation. It uses `Docusaurus` and `Api Document`, and uses `typescript`'s document comments and declaration files to generate HTML pages.
- `ðŸ“‚output`: The built code will be output to this directory. Its subdirectories `coinferjs`, `coinferjs-node` and `coinferjs-react` correspond to the three packages built by this project.
- `ðŸ“‚src`: Source code folder.
   - `ðŸ“‚react-tools`: This folder provides some tools that are convenient for using the React framework, such as the `WebSocket` library that encapsulates permission verification and initialization, context tools, and some Hooks.
   - `ðŸ“„local_utils.js`: Store code that is only used in the local `Node` environment, such as reading and writing local files, etc.
   - `ðŸ“„proxy_server.js`: Used to provide proxy server functionality.
   - `ðŸ“„coinfer.ts`: The main file of the code library encapsulates most of the business functions, such as: operating the model list, operating the `Experiment` list, adding and deleting tokens, providing `WebSocket` to obtain `Experiment` information, etc.
- `ðŸ“‚tests`: The folder mainly stores the code used for testing.

## How to build

1. Run one of these commands:
- `yarn rollup`, this command will monitor the project file for changes and compile it automatically.
2. Wait a while until the code is built. The bundled files will be located in the `output` directory.
3. In the `output` directory, you can see these directories:
   1. `coinferjs`: It just contains a coinfer.js, it provides entities CRUD.
   2. `coinferjs-node`: Provide a node-based program that can be called from the command line, such as "node index.js --help", of course, this command depends on "Nodejs".
   3. `coinferjs-react`: Provider some hooks and context of React.
   4. `demo`: This directory is for real-time development.

4. Build the docs. After successfully running `yarn rollup`, you can generate the documentation by running `yarn build:docs`. The final output directory is located at `document-generator/website`, and the generation process follows the sequence `*.ts -> *.d.ts -> *.api.json -> *.md -> *.html.`.

```
yarn build:docs
```

5. You can copy the dist files to your project. Of course, you can also publish these output files as npm packages.

## Unit Test
- `yarn test`

## Export binary
Running `yarn build`, the binary file after building is in the `output` directory

## Reference
- We generate documentation using `API extractor`, `API documenter`, and `Docusaurus`.
